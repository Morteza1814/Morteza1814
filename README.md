- 👋 Hi, I’m Morteza!
- 👀 My research focuses on applying Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures to diverse applications, such as Large Language Models (e.g., Transformers), Graph Processing (e.g., Triangle Counting), Hyperdimensional Computing, and Bioinformatics (e.g., DNA genome alignment).
- 💡 I developed a genome alignment tool called PARMIK, which surpasses BLAST in both speed and accuracy. This work was recently submitted to Genome Biology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which fits in my expertise scope.
- 📫 How to reach me: morteza@virginia.edu
